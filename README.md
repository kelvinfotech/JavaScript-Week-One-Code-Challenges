# Project:
JavaScript Week One Code Challenges.

#### Date:
23 March 2024.

#### Author:
Mwenda Kelvin.

## Description:
This is a combination of three projects which include;
(I) A Student Grade Generator which basically prompts a user to enter student marks between the range of 0 and 100 then outputs the grade (from grade A to grade E) based on the marks of the student and in a situation whereby a user inputs an invalid input, it will display an error message.
(II) A Speed Detector which basically, its purpose is to calculate the demerit points for speeding violations by drivers whereby it checks if the speed is within the required speed limit and prints "Ok" but if the speed exceeds the required speed limit, it calculates the demerit points based on how much over the limit the speed is and then outputs the points and in a situation whereby the demerit points exceed or equal the maximum demerit points allowed, it outputs a "License suspended" message.
(III) A Net Salary Calculator which basically calculates the net salary of an employee based on their basic salary and benefits including the gross salary, tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and the net salary.
